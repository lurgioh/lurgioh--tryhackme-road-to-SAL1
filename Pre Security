## Offensive Security

- Hacking first machine
- We used Gobuster to bruteforce the FakeBank website to find hidden directories and pages
- Opened terminal and typed in the command:  
  `gobuster dir -u http://fakebank.thm -w wordlist.txt`
- The `-u` is used to state the website we are scanning  
- The `-w` takes a list of words to iterate through to find hidden pages
- After the scan came back it said `/bank-transfer (status: 200)`
- Now that we found the bank-transfer page we typed that into the URL and it brought us to the transfer site
- After gaining access to that page I was able to put in two bank numbers and transfer 2000  
- This is a known vulnerability/exploit which is something that needs to be reported

## Introduction to Defensive Security

Defensive security is focused on:  
- Preventing intrusions from occurring  
- Detecting intrusions when they occur  
- Responding properly to limit damage  

### Tasks related to defensive security
- **User cybersecurity awareness:** training users about cyber threats to protect against attacks  
- **Documenting and managing assets:** knowing the systems and devices that must be managed and protected  
- **Updating and patching systems:** ensuring computers, servers, and network devices are updated to prevent weaknesses  
- **Setting up preventative security devices:**  
  - Firewalls → control what network traffic enters the network  
  - IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) → blocks traffic that matches rules or attack signatures  
- **Setting up logging and monitoring devices:**  
  - Proper logging and monitoring are essential for detecting malicious activities  
  - Example: if a new unauthorized device appears on the network, it should be detected

## What is SOC?

- A Security Operations Center (SOC) is responsible for:  
  - Monitoring systems and networks  
  - Detecting intrusions  
  - Responding to incidents  
  - Improving defenses based on threat intelligence
