Introduction to Defensive Security
-Prenveting intrusion from occurring
-Detecting intrusion when they occur and responding properly
Tasks related to defensive security
-User cyber security awareness: this is the process of training users about cyber security helps protect against any attacks targeting their systems
-Documenting and managing assest: this is knowing the systems and devices that we must manage and protect 
-Updating and patching systems: this ensures that the computers, servers, and netword devices are correctly updated which helps prevent waakness
-Setting up preventative security devices: firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical componentes to prevetative security. Firewall control what network traffic
enters the network. IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures
-Setting up logging and monitoring devices: proper network logging and monitoring are essential for detecting malicious activies and intrusions. IF a new unauthorized devices appears on our network, we should detect it
